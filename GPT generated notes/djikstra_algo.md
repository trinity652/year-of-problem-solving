Sure, here's a tutorial on Dijkstra's algorithm:

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It works by maintaining a set of visited nodes and a set of unvisited nodes, and iteratively selecting the unvisited node with the shortest distance from the starting node.

### Algorithm Steps

1. Assign a distance value to every node in the graph. Initialize the starting node with a distance of 0 and all other nodes with a distance of infinity.
2. Create a set of visited nodes and an empty set of unvisited nodes.
3. Set the current node to the starting node and add it to the unvisited set.
4. While there are still unvisited nodes:
   1. Select the unvisited node with the shortest distance from the starting node.
   2. Add the current node to the visited set and remove it from the unvisited set.
   3. For each neighbor of the current node:
      1. Calculate the distance from the starting node to the neighbor through the current node.
      2. If the calculated distance is shorter than the neighbor's current distance, update the neighbor's distance.
   4. If the destination node has been visited, terminate the algorithm and return the shortest path.

### Implementation in Python

Here's an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in Python:

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start, end):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    visited = set()
    unvisited = [(0, start)]

    while unvisited:
        (distance, current) = heapq.heappop(unvisited)
        if current == end:
            return distance
        
        visited.add(current)
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current].items():
            if neighbor in visited:
                continue
            new_distance = distances[current] + weight
            if new_distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = new_distance
                heapq.heappush(unvisited, (new_distance, neighbor))
                
    return None
```

In this implementation, we represent the graph as a dictionary of dictionaries, where each key represents a node and each value represents a dictionary of neighbors and their weights. We use a priority queue (implemented as a heap) to keep track of unvisited nodes and their distances from the starting node. We initialize the distances to infinity and the starting node to 0, and update the distances as we iterate over the neighbors of each node.

To use this implementation, you can create a graph and call the `dijkstra` function with the starting and ending nodes:

```python
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}

distance = dijkstra(graph, 'A', 'D')
print(distance) # Output: 3
```

In this example, we create a simple graph and compute the shortest distance between nodes 'A' and 'D' using Dijkstra's algorithm.
